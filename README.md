Purpose
-------

Explore the distribution of the marital status' of the inhabitants Copenhagen.  
All answers are for the exercises found at: https://github.com/szEIgo/UnrulyKnife

Getting Started
-------
All the exercises are answered in one file, runnable.py. All the different plots are generated in seperate functions and are called at the bottom of the file. 
1. Download runnable.py and movies.csv files.  
2. Run the Exercise.py file. All the charts will be generated as .png files.  
3. Some results may be printed to the console. For testing purposes.
4. At the bottom of the runnable.py file, every function is called. Feel free to outcomment if only specific functions are supposed to be called

Questions asked
-------
1. Create histograms of rating, length and length of title.
2. Create a graph showing both year and amount of movies made. 
3. Make a scatter-plot with year and length of movies. (Try to find clusters and explain them. Wild guesses are accepted).
4. Apply the MeanShift algorithm to identify all the clusters in the scatter-plot from Question 3.
